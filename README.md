# Inform
This repository is for my Inform projects and I hope to upload them around 1st of April 2023 in connection with interactive fiction Source Code Amnesty Day. In addition I might add some "source code" for my Adrift games too as the taf-file corresponds to source code in such a graphical user interface and perhaps also my GAC source file for The Dragon Diamond so that the C64-version can be ported to other 8-bit platforms that ran GAC games (Amstrad, Spectrum and BBC Micro).
